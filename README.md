# Neural Network from scratch (only NumPy)

This brief project was made to further learn and understand the math and code behind a basic Neural Network. The code is heavily based on the lecture ["Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) from [Samson Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/@SamsonZhangTheSalmon) that's publicly avaliable on YouTube.

For testing purposes, the model is trained on the commonly recognised MNIST dataset, which aims to predict digits from 28x28 pixel images.
